1. Answer each of the following with True or False in the context of SVM giving reasons. [1x3=3 marks]

a) SVM classifier has quick training time with large dataset.

b) SVM classifier does not perform well when number of dimensions are more than number of records.

c) SVM classifier can handle both linearly and non-linearly separable datasets.

2. Do the following on breast cancer dataset. Perform 70:30 train(Tr) and test (Te) split.

a) Use Tr data for building linear SVM model and evaluate it’s performance (F1 score) using Te data. [2 marks]

b) Use the same Tr data for building polynomial SVM model and evaluate it’s performance (F1 score) using the same Te data. [2 marks]

c) Draw bar chart depicting blue bar for linear SVM and red bar for polynomial SVM, compare their performance based on precision, recall, accuracy and F1-score. [2 marks]
